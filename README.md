# Get Cryptic

Work through these exercises from Cryptopals Set 1 (**[http://cryptopals.com/sets/1](http://cryptopals.com/sets/1)**)
Get as far as you can.

Try to TDD the solution if able.

***Optional but recommended***

You should write the code to parse hexidecimal and base64 as well instead of using built in functions, it's more fun than it sounds.

## Hex (*[More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal)*)

In computing hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a base of 16. 

It uses sixteen distinct symbols the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen.

    
| Value |    Hex     |
|-------|------------|
| 0-9   | A-Z or a-z |
| A-F   | 10-15      |

Each hex digit represents exactly 4 bits of data.

                              =  5EB52 Hexidecimal


## Base64 (*[More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)*)

In computing base64 is a positional numeral system with a base of 64.

It uses sixty four distinct symbols the symbols A–Z to represent values 0-25, a-z to represent values 26-51, 0-9 to represent 52-61, + to represent 62 and / to represent 63.

The final '==' sequence indicates that the last group contained only one byte, and '=' indicates that it contained two bytes. 

|  Value  | Hex |
|---------|-----|
| 0-25    | A–Z |
| 26-51   | a-z |
| 52-61   | 0-9 |
| 62      | +   |
| 63      | /   |
| Padding | =   |

Each base64 digit represents exactly 6 bits of data.

## [Bitwise Operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation)

### NOT (*[More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#NOT)*)

The **bitwise NOT**, or **complement**, is a unary operation that performs logical negation on each bit, forming the ones' complement of the given binary value. Bits that are 0 become 1, and those that are 1 become 0. For example:

    NOT 0111  (decimal 7)
      = 1000  (decimal 8)

### AND (*[More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND)*)

A bitwise AND takes two equal-length binary representations and performs the logical AND operation on each pair of the corresponding bits, by multiplying them. 

Thus, if both bits in the compared position are 1, the bit in the resulting binary representation is 1 (1 × 1 = 1); otherwise, the result is 0 (1 × 0 = 0 and 0 × 0 = 0). For example:

        0101 (decimal 5)
    AND 0011 (decimal 3)
      = 0001 (decimal 1)

### OR (*[More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR)*)

A bitwise OR takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical inclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. 

The result in each position is 0 if both bits are 0, while otherwise the result is 1. For example:

       0101 (decimal 5)
    OR 0011 (decimal 3)
     = 0111 (decimal 7)

### XOR (*[More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)*)

A bitwise XOR takes two bit patterns of equal length and performs the logical exclusive OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 or only the second bit is 1, but will be 0 if both are 0 or both are 1. 

In this we perform the comparison of two bits, being 1 if the two bits are different, and 0 if they are the same. For example:

        0110 (decimal 6)
    XOR 1010 (decimal 10)
      = 1100 (decimal 12)

### Logical shift (*[More info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_shift )*)

The bit shifts are sometimes considered bitwise operations, because they treat a value as a series of bits rather than as a numerical quantity. In these operations the digits are moved, or shifted, to the left or right

In a logical shift, zeros are shifted in to replace the discarded bits.

This example uses an 8-bit register:

       00010111 LEFT-SHIFT
    =  00101110 
    
       10010111 RIGHT-SHIFT
    =  01001011
    
       00010111 LEFT-SHIFT-BY-TWO
    =  01011100
